# AVIATOR Features

A Victim Information App To Ohio Resources (AVIATOR) provides a single access point to community resources that allows victims to easily search for and contact local service providers based on their needs. Specifically, AVIATOR offers assistance in finding:
#### Personal Resources
Whether someone is a victim of a crime or a victim of circumstances, AVIATOR provides quick access to a multitude of different resources. Have you lost your house due to unemployment or a natural disaster? Are you feeling ill, but cannot afford a doctor’s visit? Or do you need help removing yourself or a loved one from a harmful domestic situation? AVIATOR can help find the services that best address your needs.
#### Law & Corrections Services
Navigating the criminal justice system is often stressful and confusing. AVIATOR lessens the learning curve by putting victims in direct contact with those who are most familiar with the justice system. In addition, AVIATOR can help users find and be alerted to any changes in the incarceration status of specific perpetrators.
#### Victim Compensation
Being a victim of a violent crime is not only emotionally devastating, but it can also put undue financial strain on families. AVIATOR will connect users to local and state-wide resources that can help victims receive financial assistance to cover expenses that are often associated with violent crimes, such as health- and funeral-related costs.
#### Specialized Services
Similar to the “Personal Resources” feature, AVIATOR can help users find specialized resources for veterans, the elderly, the deaf community, and more.
#### Crisis Contacts
In times of extreme mental or emotional despair, AVIATOR provides quick access to a list of local service providers that offer 24-hour manned phone lines for a multitude of different crises, ranging from suicide prevention to domestic violence help. Regardless of the situation, a real person will always be ready to assist AVIATOR users in their time of need.
#### Other features
In the event that you need immediate help from a trusted friend or family member, AVIATOR allows users to instantly send a custom message to 5 trusted family members or friends without leaving the app. In addition, the app can quickly be hidden and replaced with a favorite website with a single touch of AVIATOR’s quick-hide button.
